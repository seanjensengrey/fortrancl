FortranCL is an OpenCL interface for Fortran 90. It allows programmers to call the [OpenCL](http://www.khronos.org/opencl/) parallel programming framework directly from Fortran, so developers can accelerate their Fortran code using graphical processing units (GPU) and other accelerators.

The interface is designed to be as close to C OpenCL interface as possible, while written in native Fortran 90 with type checking. It was originally designed as an OpenCL interface to be used by the [Octopus code](http://tddft.org/programs/octopus).

The interface is not complete but provides all the basic calls required to write a full Fortran 90 OpenCL program.
